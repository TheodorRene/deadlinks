# deadlinks

Who doesn't hate it when they visit a project on Github and the links in the README
are dead? The purpose of this project is to check all the links in a README to
see if they are dead. 

## TODO
1. Get README from a github url
2. Handle URL that point to nonexisting sites (Throws an exception at the
   moment)
4. Create Github Action using the script so it can be added to a deploy pipeline
3. Create an issue on the Github repo
